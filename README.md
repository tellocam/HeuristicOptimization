# HeuristicOptimization
Repo for the lecture 192.137 Heuristic Optimization Techniques VU 4.5ECTS WS23 at TU Vienna
with Prof. G. Raidl
Programming Exercise 1 content:
  Solution to K-Plex problem (here defined as S-Plex Problem)
  Given a Graph G with n weighted vertices
  Form Adjacency and Weight Matrix A and W
  find S-Plex with minimal costs via:
    - Deterministic Construction Heuristic
    - Randomized Construction Heuristic
    - Variable Neighborhood Descent Method (VNS)
    - Greedy Randomized Adaptive Neighborhood Search (GRASP)
