### 192.137 Heuristic Optimization Techniques VU 4.5ECTS WS23 at TU Vienna

Programming Exercise 1 content: Solution to K-Plex problem (here defined as S-Plex Problem) \
  
  * Given a Graph G with n weighted vertices Form Adjacency and Weight Matrix A and W and find S-Plex with minimal costs via:
    - Deterministic Construction Heuristic
    - Randomized Construction Heuristic
    - Variable Neighborhood Descent Method (VNS)
    - Greedy Randomized Adaptive Neighborhood Search (GRASP)
  
Programming Exercise 2 content: Solution to K-Plex Problem with ant colony system and genetic algorithm
To Do For Camilo:
  - Make Sure wrong edge assignments are allowed,
  - make 1 function out of choose_greedy! and choose_roulette function
  - generate a repair function that deterministically repairs s-plexes in a smart way such that after every iteration there
    are valid s-plexes!
