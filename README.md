Programming Exercise 1 content: Solution to K-Plex problem (here defined as S-Plex Problem) \
  
  * Given a Graph G with n weighted vertices Form Adjacency and Weight Matrix A and W and find S-Plex with minimal costs via:
    - Deterministic Construction Heuristic
    - Randomized Construction Heuristic
    - Variable Neighborhood Descent Method (VNS)
    - Greedy Randomized Adaptive Neighborhood Search (GRASP)
